## ✨ Key Features

- **🖼️ Multi-Modal Analysis**: Seamlessly handle both high-resolution images and multi-frame video files.
- **⚡ Fast-API Powered**: Migrated to a modern, asynchronous backend for lightning-fast inference and type safety.
- **💾 0-Disk Footprint**: Advanced in-memory processing ensures your uploads, heatmaps, and reports never touch the local disk.
- **🔥 Grad-CAM Heatmaps**: Explainable AI (XAI) that visually highlights the exact areas of a face suspected of being manipulated.
- **📊 Detailed Reporting**: Generate professional PDF or JSON reports on the fly, complete with frame-by-the-frame probability tables.
- **🟢 Real-Time Status**: Dynamic system monitoring in the UI to ensure the detection engine is always ready.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deepfake-Detector.git
cd Deepfake-Detector
```

### 2️⃣ Setup the Backend
```powershell
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
> [!TIP]
> The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`. You can explore the interactive API docs at `/docs`.

### 3️⃣ Setup the Frontend
```powershell
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
> [!NOTE]
> Visit `http://localhost:8080` (or your Vite port) to start detecting!

## 📖 How it Works

1. **Upload**: Drop an image or video into the dashboard.
2. **Detection**: The system extracts faces using `facenet-pytorch`.
3. **Analysis**: An **EfficientNet-B0** model, fine-tuned on the **FaceForensics++ (FF++)** dataset, analyzes facial texture and artifacts.
4. **Result**: Get a clear *Real* or *Fake* verdict with a confidence score.
5. **Visualization**: Review top-K manipulated frames highlighted with Grad-CAM heatmaps.
